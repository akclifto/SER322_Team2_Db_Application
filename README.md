# SER322_Team2_Db_Application
SER322 Project Team 2 database application implementation for team deliverable

# DELIVERABLE REQUIREMENTS:
Deliverable 3: Database Implementation
Given the E-R diagram and sets of attributes for each entity, the next step is to convert
the E-R model into a relational model and implement the database tables.
• Data should be supplied for each table. The amount of data should be such
that the application can be tested and demonstrated.
• Identify and write a variety of SQL queries to demonstrate the usefulness of
your database
Deliverables (via Canvas):
• Relational Model figure (similar to Assignment 4)
• SQL scripts (scripts for creation of the database and tables)
• SQL Scripts to load tables with sample data
• SQL scripts for most important queries (SELECT queries)



Deliverable 4: Application Implementation and Demo/Presentation
Build a Java-based application that uses the database that you have created. Provide a
simple UI that can be used to enter parameters for the queries and display results from
the database. The UI can be a text-only that uses the Command Line Interface (CLI) or a
graphic UI or a web application. The application must display a menu and return to that
menu after each action without the need to relaunch the application each time.
Deliverables:
• Updated E-R diagram(s) (if any updates were made)
• Complete source code of Java application
• Readme with instructions on creating the database and setting up the application
• Video (approximately 5 minutes in length) demonstrating the application and
explaining the structure of the code.
